# Kana Writing Practice Application - Technical Specification

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Frontend (Gradio Interface)**
   - Interactive drawing canvas (300px high, 900px wide)
   - Word group selection interface
   - Clear canvas functionality
   - Multi-character input support
   - Loading indicator for API calls
   - Audio playback controls with progress indicator and speed adjustment

2. **Backend Services**
   - AWS Bedrock for OCR and character recognition
   - Amazon Polly for text-to-speech conversion
   - Image preprocessing service for contrast enhancement
   - API rate limiting implementation
   - Caching system for frequently used words and audio

## Technical Requirements

### Development Stack
- Python 3.9+
- Gradio for UI
- AWS SDK (boto3)
- Image processing libraries

### API Integration
#### Endpoints
1. GET /api/groups
   - Returns available word groups
   - Implements rate limiting
   - 30-second timeout with loading indicator

2. POST /api/validate
   - Accepts image data (jpg, png)
   - Maximum file size: 10MB
   - Implements contrast enhancement preprocessing
   - Returns exact match validation results
   - 30-second timeout with loading indicator

3. GET /api/audio
   - Returns audio file for selected word
   - Supports speed adjustment
   - Implements caching for frequently used words
   - 30-second timeout with loading indicator

### User Interface Requirements
1. Drawing Canvas
   - Dimensions: 300px high, 900px wide
   - Multi-character input support
   - Clear canvas button
   - No grid lines or guide marks
   - No reference images while drawing

2. Audio Playback
   - Speed adjustment controls
   - Progress indicator during playback
   - No automatic playback for new words
   - Cached audio for frequently used words

3. File Handling
   - Supported formats: JPG, PNG
   - Maximum file size: 10MB
   - No batch upload support
   - Image preprocessing: contrast enhancement

### Error Handling
1. Backend Service Unavailability
   - User-friendly error messages indicating which service failed
   - No automatic retries
   - Specific error handling for AWS services (Bedrock/Polly)

2. OCR Processing
   - Failed OCR treated as incorrect match
   - No confidence score implementation
   - No retry attempt limits

### Performance Considerations
1. API Rate Limiting
   - Implemented for Bedrock and Polly services
   - 30-second timeout for all API calls
   - Loading indicators during API calls

2. Caching
   - Audio files for frequently used words
   - Kana representations for common words
   - No offline mode support

### Progress Tracking
- No user progress tracking
- No success rate tracking
- No storage of successful attempts
