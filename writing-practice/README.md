# Kana Writing Practice

A Gradio-based web application for practicing Japanese kana writing with AWS services integration.

## Features
- Interactive writing canvas
- AWS Bedrock integration for word generation and translation
- Amazon Polly integration for audio playback
- Progress tracking and performance metrics

## Technical Uncertainty
- Will AWS Bedrock even work? It didn't work in a previous attempt. See https://github.com/danielwohlgemuth/ai-recipe-generator.
- Is Amazon Developer Q usable enough to generate the code for the app?

## Setup
1. Install dependencies
2. Configure AWS credentials
3. Run the Gradio application

## Development
See [Technical Specs](Technical-Specs.md) for detailed architecture and implementation plans.
