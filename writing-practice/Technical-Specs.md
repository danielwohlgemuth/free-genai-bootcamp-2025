# Kana Writing Practice Application Technical Specification

## Overview
A web-based application for practicing Japanese kana writing using AWS services and Gradio interface.

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Frontend (Gradio Interface)**
   - Writing canvas for user input
   - Display area for kana characters
   - Audio playback interface
   - Translation display
   - Practice mode selection

2. **Backend Services**
   - AWS Bedrock integration for word generation and translation
   - AWS Polly integration for text-to-speech
   - Session management and progress tracking

### AWS Services
1. **AWS Bedrock**
   - Generate Japanese vocabulary words
   - Provide English translations
   - Validate user input

2. **AWS Polly**
   - Convert Japanese text to speech
   - Support for native Japanese voice options

## Technical Requirements

### Development Stack
- Python 3.9+
- Gradio framework for UI
- AWS SDK (boto3) for AWS services integration
- Docker for containerization

### Core Features
1. **Writing Practice**
   - Canvas for drawing kana characters
   - Real-time stroke order validation
   - Clear/undo functionality

2. **Word Generation**
   - Random word selection
   - Difficulty levels (basic to advanced)
   - Category-based word groups

3. **Audio Support**
   - Text-to-speech for generated words
   - Playback controls
   - Speed adjustment options

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - User session history
   - Performance metrics
   - Improvement tracking

### Data Flow
1. Application generates word using AWS Bedrock
2. Translation is provided by AWS Bedrock
3. Audio is generated using AWS Polly
4. User writes character on canvas
5. System validates input
6. Progress is recorded

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
- Set up project structure
- Implement AWS service connections
- Create basic Gradio interface

### Phase 2: Core Features
- Implement writing canvas
- Add word generation
- Integrate audio playback

### Phase 3: Enhancement
- Add progress tracking
- Implement user feedback
- Add additional practice modes

## Security Considerations
- AWS IAM roles and permissions
- API key management
- User data protection

## Performance Requirements
- Response time < 2 seconds
- Audio generation < 1 second
- Canvas responsiveness < 100ms

## Future Enhancements
- Multiple writing systems support
- Customizable practice sessions
- Social features and sharing
- Mobile device optimization
