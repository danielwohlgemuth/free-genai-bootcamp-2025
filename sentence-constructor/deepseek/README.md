Prompt:

> Is there a prompt engineering guide for deepseek?

Result:

1. Understand the Model's Capabilities
Know the strengths and limitations of the model. For example, DeepSeek may excel in certain tasks like text generation, summarization, or coding assistance.
Test the model with simple prompts to gauge its performance.
2. Be Clear and Specific.
Use precise language to convey your intent.
Avoid ambiguous or vague instructions.
3. Provide Context
Include relevant background information to guide the model.
4. Use Examples
Provide examples to clarify the desired output format or style.
5. Break Down Complex Tasks
Divide complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
6. Experiment with Prompt Formats
Try different formats to see what works best:
    - Instructional: "Explain how photosynthesis works.
    - Question-Based: "What is photosynthesis, and why is it important?"
    - Role-Playing: "You are a biology teacher. Teach me about photosynthesis."
7. Use Constraints.
Add constraints to refine the output.
8. Iterate and Refine.
Test and tweak your prompts to improve results.
If the output isn't satisfactory, rephrase or add more detail to your prompt.
9. Leverage System Messages (if available).
Some models allow you to set a system message to define the AI's behavior.
10. Avoid Bias and Misleading Prompts.
Ensure your prompts are neutral and unbiased.
11. Use Temperature and Sampling Parameters (if available).
Adjust parameters like temperature (for creativity) or top-p (for diversity) to control the output.
12. Test for Edge Cases.
Try unusual or edge-case prompts to understand the model's behavior.
13. Combine Prompts for Multi-Step Tasks.
Chain prompts together for complex tasks.
